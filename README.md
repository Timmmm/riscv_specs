# RISC-V Specs

This repo hosts HTML copies of the RISC-V privileged and unprivileged specs that you can bookmark and link to. No more downloading PDFs and `.html` files!

https://riscv-specs.timhutt.co.uk/

For example, you can directly link to [`mstatus`](https://riscv-specs.timhutt.co.uk/spec/20240411/priv-isa-asciidoc.html#_machine_status_registers_mstatus_and_mstatush) or [`sh3add`](https://riscv-specs.timhutt.co.uk/spec/20240411/unpriv-isa-asciidoc.html#insns-sh3add).

I will try to keep the URLs stable, but they aren't official.

New spec releases are in theory added automatically by Github Actions, assuming it works.
